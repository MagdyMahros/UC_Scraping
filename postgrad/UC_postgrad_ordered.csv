Graduates are likely to be already employed or find employment in creative industries. Many are likely to be self-employed. A goal of the course is to equip graduates with the knowledge and skills to start or expand their own creative businesses.The course will be offered for part-time study at this time. It is envisaged that a full-time option will be offered in the future. Unit content and sequencing have been designed to provide a scaffolded learning experience.
